                Kohli's passion for the sport began at a young age, and he has since become one of the most successful captains of the Indian national team. He has broken numerous records, including being one of the fastest to score 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, 11,000, and 12,000 runs in One Day Internationals (ODIs). Under his captaincy, India has achieved remarkable success, including a historic Test series win in Australia.

                In recent years, Kohli has continued to excel both on and off the field. He stepped down as India's T20I captain in 2021 but remains a vital player for the team in all formats. Beyond cricket, Kohli is known for his fitness regimen and is a major advocate for leading a healthy lifestyle. He is also a successful entrepreneur, with ventures in the fashion industry through his brand Wrogn, and in the hospitality sector with his chain of gyms and restaurants.
